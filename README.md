# Spring + React Collection 

This repo is a collection of Spring Boot and React projects created while learning full-stack web development. Includes standalone Spring Boot REST APIs and React-based frontends, with an emphasis on backend design, API development, and frontend integration.

### Branches:

1. [restFull-APi](https://github.com/Preacher-Y/WebTech/tree/restFull_api_26500): this is to get familiar with Spring and also how to create simple API without DB;
